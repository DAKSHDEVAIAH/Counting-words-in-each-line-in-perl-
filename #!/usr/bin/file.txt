The MAX Orange Line is a light rail service in Portland, Oregon, United States, operated by TriMet as part of the MAX Light Rail system.
It connects Portland City Center to Portland State University, Southeast Portland, Milwaukie, and Oak Grove.
The Portland–Milwaukie Light Rail Project was the second and final phase of the South Corridor Project that in its first phase expanded light rail services to Interstate 205 and the Portland Transit Mall.
The extension, which followed years of failed light rail plans for Clackamas County, began construction work in mid-2011.
As part of the project, TriMet built Tilikum Crossing (pictured), billed as "the largest car-free bridge in the United States", over the Willamette River.
The extension opened to Orange Line service on September 12, 2015.
The line serves 17 stations and runs for 201⁄2 hours daily with a minimum headway of 15 minutes during most of the day. (Full article...)
